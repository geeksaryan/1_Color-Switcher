# Background Color Switcher

This is a simple web-based project that allows users to change the background color of the webpage by clicking on different color buttons. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Interactive Buttons**: Each button represents a color or gradient. Clicking on a button changes the background color of the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Hover Effects**: Buttons have hover effects to enhance the user interface.
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Includes gradient color options for a visually appealing design.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
2. **`style.css`**: The CSS file that styles the webpage, including button designs and responsive layout.
3. **`script.js`**: The JavaScript file that handles the button click events and changes the background color dynamically.
4. **`readme.md`**: This file, which provides an overview of the project.

## How It Works

1. The webpage displays a set of buttons, each representing a specific color or gradient.
2. When a user clicks on a button, a JavaScript event listener detects the click and changes the background color of the page accordingly.
3. The colors include solid colors like pink, green, and blue, as well as gradient options like mixed sky and sky red.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Click on the buttons to see the background color change.
